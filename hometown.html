            <h3>My Hometown, Jackson</h3>
            <p>As of 2023, Jackson has a population of roughly 31,000 citizens ("Jackson, MI | Data USA", n.d.). In 1829, Jackson was incorporated
                into Michigan ("Jackson | Michigan, Map, History, & Facts | Britannica.", n.d.). Jackson is located in south-central Michigan, only roughly an hour drive away from the Michigan 
                southern border. The city of Jackson is an urbanized area. The median income per household is roughly $42,000,
                which is significantly lower than the median statewide household income of about $42,000 ("Jackson MI | Data USA", n.d.).

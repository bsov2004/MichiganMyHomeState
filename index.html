            <p>&emsp;My home state is the <em>Great Lakes</em> state, Michigan. I have been a citizen
            of Michigan for my entire life. Michigan is home to the five Great Lakes, which give Michigan
            it's iconic mitten shape. With a population of roughly 10 million people, Michigan is home to
            a diverse group of people ("Fun Facts about Michigan", n.d.). Michigan is split into two peninsulas, known as the Upper Peninsula
            and the Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula is known for the beautiful nature rapant throughout 
            the peninsula. The Lower Peninsula is known for the cities that give Michigan it's identity and 
            makes it stand out from the other states.</p>

            <h3>History of Michigan</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Michigan began as a territory for Native Americans, like most areas of the United States.
            Michigan became a U.S. territory in 1805 and became the 26th State in 1837. Detroit was the first
            capital of Michigan, however in 1879, Lansing became the capital. In 1908, Henry Ford created the
            Ford Model T, permenantly associating Michigan with the creation of the autoindustry (Hathaway & Schaetzl, 1999).</p>

            <h3>Life in Michigan</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Michigan resides in the Midwest, just south of Canada. Michigan experiences all four seasons.
            Winters are especially cold, prompting plenty of winter activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, and sledding.
            With over 10,000 lakes in Michigan, the summers are spent boating, fishing and relaxing on the water.
            Michigan has unique natural structures that are prime tourist spots including Sleeping Bear Dunes, 
            Tahquamenon Falls and Pictured Rocks. There is a vast diversity when it comes to the population of Michigan.
            There is a large muslim population in the southeast and there are several indigenous reservations throughout the state.
            The southern area of Michigan also has a large black population ("National Historic Landmarks | MiPlace", n.d.).
